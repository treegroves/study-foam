# **Command Line**

### **Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?**

Sticking exactly to a timebox is something that takes a bit of work to achieve. I didn't quite stay within the timebox, exceeding it by an hour or so.

I went over the limit, but I'm treating the timeboxes like *guidelines* and not *rules*.

Why I exceeded the timebox:
- I got stuck into the ***Learn the Command Line*** course over at [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) and started learning the more advanced command line features. Before I got *too* far ***"Just in time learning"*** drifted into my thoughts.
- I repeated what I had learned in the terminal, maybe a bit too much, but I'm a synesthetic learner - can't ignore that!
- I also didn't come up with a plan to break the module into smaller tasks. Tomorrow I will set aside time to do that before diving in.


### **Name five commands you used and what they do.**

1. `pwd` - ***print working directory***: The title gives this one away, it's a command that asks in which directory the user is working; it shows which directory the user is in.
2. `ls` - ***list***: This command allows the user to see a list of files and directories in the current folder. `li` can be modified with *Options* or *flags*. `-a` shows all, `-l` shows the long version, `-t` arranges items chronologically. 
3. `cd` - ***change directory***: used to change directories and navigate the file tree. It can be used with `..` to go up one level, `../../` to go up multiple levels, `../other_directory` to go up then down into another directory etc.
4. `rm` - ***Remove***: Can be used to delete files. add `-r` to delete directories including child directories.
5. `cp` - ***Copy***: used to copy files between directories or to overwrite existing  files.



### **Did you learn anything unexpected?**
The two commands I didn't expect were:
- `cat` which lets you read the contents of a file without opening it.
- The ability to insert the contents of one document into another with `cp`

I didn't realize the level of control terminal commands/arguments really had - I can see why developers prefer it to the terminals graphical counterparts!
