# **Install and Explore Git**

### **What is a Git workflow?**
There are various forms of Git workflow, but they all standardised the way in which git commits are merged into the main branch.

The basic workflow for making commits is as follows:
1. Make changes
2. add changes to staging index
3. commit them to the repository 

Each commit requires a basic singular message to be added before a commit can pass. This can either be done in the Editor, or by adding a `-m` flag to `git commit`. e.g. `git commit -m "Changed heading"` 


### **What did you notice about your learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?**

I found my learning didn't have any confusion or blocks. Practicing the material, while following along helped me take the concepts onboard. I also started using reflection after each new piece of information and taking notes.

### **Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration?**

In this case, no. Following the Udacity course was fun. I like how it is designed to prompt students to practice and apply the techniques.
The descriptions in "How Git Works, Git Terminology and Git Commands" are laid out clearly and make sense.
