# **Branch, pull, merge**

### **What is main?**
you can think of the main as the best version of your project.

### **Why create a branch?**
if you have a feature to add to the project, but want to work on it separately until it's ready to go into the main without causing any problems, you create a branch. What happens on the branch stays on the branch until someone merges it on to the main.

### **Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?**
The tree analogy helps me get my head around the concepts. The concepts lend themselves to visual thinking, which helps me intuitively reach an understanding.
