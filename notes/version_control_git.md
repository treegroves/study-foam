# **Version Control with Git**
### **What's the difference between Git and GitHub?**
-  *Git* is a form of ***Version Control Software***
-  *GitHub* is an online social network and cloud hosting service for developers. It can *facilitate* version control.
### **Can you think of an analogy to describe them?**
Using the analogy of a river system,
*Git* represents the sources of tributary streams, the streams can be dammed or rerouted to merge with other streams. *Github* is the geography through which the river system flows.

### **Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?**

Yes. But I do have previous learning experiences that have already solidified the material - at least the basics.

### **Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?**
I didn't quite spend the entire timebox allotment as I have already read into and applied some of the basics of Git and GitHub.
