## *How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?* 
It is like shopping for a new dining table with your partner. You both might be shopping around different websites, finding tables you like.
It's not okay to just go out and buy one without tabling it as an option with your partner - they'll probably get a bit mad. 

So instead, as each of you find a possible tables, you suggest them. You end up with a nice collection of tables in your *"staging area"* to choose from and you *commit* to one of them, which you end up putting up in your dining room.
