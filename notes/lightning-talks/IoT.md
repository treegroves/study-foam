The devices send data

closed private connections communcating with other via IoT platforms


Applications


supply chain:

"Deploying IoT devices across different parts of the supply chain — from manufacturing plant floors to transportation and distribution center inventory systems — offers visibility and data collection. Connecting these devices to IoT device management platforms centralizes that visibility and delivers real-time insights where they’re needed most. And companies can use machine learning to develop smart supply chain IoT that maximizes supply chain efficiency."
